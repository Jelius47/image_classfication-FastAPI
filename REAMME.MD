# Digit Image Classifier with FastAPI

This project is a **REST API** built using **FastAPI** that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) from images. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model (loaded from a `.pkl` file) to predict the digit in an uploaded image. The API is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to integrate with frontend applications.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Accepts image files (e.g., PNG, JPEG) for digit classification.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a pre-trained model (`mnist_model_image_classifier.pkl`) for predictions.
- **CORS Support**: Allows cross-origin requests for integration with frontend applications.
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Built with FastAPI for high performance and scalability.

---

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing (conversion, resizing, and inversion).
- **NumPy**: For converting images into arrays compatible with the machine learning model.
- **Scikit-learn**: The machine learning framework used to train the model.
- **Pickle**: For loading the pre-trained model from a `.pkl` file.
